Title: | ETL Change - Integration of BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS into BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT

Background: | As part of regulatory reporting enhancements, we are incorporating metadata about branch operations (manager, region, last audit) into the core reporting layer. This is to ensure that audit trails and compliance checks include contextual metadata.

Changes Introduced:

Item | Description
Source Table | BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS (Oracle)
Target Table | BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT (Databricks Delta)
Columns Added | REGION, LAST_AUDIT_DATE
ETL Change Summary | PySpark logic to join new table, conditionally populate
Deployment Note | Requires full reload of BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT

Data Mapping Example:

Source Column | Target Column
BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS.REGION | BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT.REGION
BRANCH_OPERATIONAL_DETAILS.LAST_AUDIT_DATE | BRANCH_SUMMARY_REPORT.LAST_AUDIT_DATE
